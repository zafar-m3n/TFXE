          Trading is the act of buying and selling financial instruments — such as stocks, currencies, or commodities —
          with the goal of making a profit from market fluctuations.

          Unlike long-term investing, trading often involves shorter timeframes and more frequent decision-making. At
          TFXE, we make trading accessible, data-driven, and designed to suit all experience levels.
